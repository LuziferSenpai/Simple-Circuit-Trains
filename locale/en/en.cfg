simple-circuit-trains=Simple Circuit Trains is a mod that lets you switch between schedules. And inside these Schedules you need to select a station, to which the train will go next.\nThe logic reads the line(schedule) from the [item=red-wire] and the station in that line(schedule) from the [item=green-wire].\n\n[font=default-bold]This happens AFTER leaving a station.\nThe tutorial shows you a example.[/font]
automatic-coupling-system-and-simple-circuit-trains=Automatic Coupling System & Simple Circuit Trains are written in a way, so that they work together without any problems.\nI even recommend that they are used together.\n\n[font=default-bold]The tutorial shows you a example for both mods working together.[/font]
