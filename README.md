# Simple-Circuit-Trains

Hey,

this Modification is my Attempt to make a very useful way to send Trains around the Map, based on Signals!
A Example Savegame is here, but this Savegame only works with my [Automatic Coupling System](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Automatic_Coupling_System)!

## How this Modification works:
 - You open the GUI and have a Train open.
 - Than you add a new Linie with the Schedule of the Train.
 - Than you assign a Signal to the Linie and to each Station on the Linie in the GUI.
 - Next when the Train arrives at a Station, it checks for Coupling Signals or/and if both Wires are connected.
 - When that is true, the Train will save the Station for it self, so it can read out the Signals when it leaves the Station.
 - Red Wire is for Schedule, Green Wire is for Station in that Schedule.
