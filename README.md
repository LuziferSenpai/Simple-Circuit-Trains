# Simple-Circuit-Trains

Hey,

this Modification is my attempt to make a very useful way to send Trains around the Map, based on Signals!
A example Savegame is here, but this Savegame only works with my Modification [Automatic Coupling System](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Automatic_Coupling_System)!
